# Helpdesk Ticket Origin Visualization Tool

### Project Description
A need came up to track the origin of support tickets. Our company management was under the impression that our IT team was over staffed. This was due to the lack of a ticketing system used by our firm. We direct users to send an email to our helpdesk email and we will respond through there.

This works great, until someone approaches us in person, and we didn't have a way to track how many times we were supporting individuals who did not open a case through the email approach. And as a three person team, who felt like we were constantly slammed, we needed to be able to prove that, or we would be reduced.

I started doing some simple tallying, with a pen and paper, and keeping track of how many tickets came through helpdesk and how many came from people in-person. This quickly led to the realization that between 65% and 75% of total support cases I would handle each day originated in person.

After playing around with a few prototyping versions, and trying to figure out what functionality would be needed, I started on this project.

### Requirements
- Ability to tally **Helpdesk tickets**
- Ability to tally **In-person tickets**
- Some form of quick visualization to show the ratio between the two *ended up with a percentage bar approach*
- A text field displaying all information, that could be exported as a .txt file for archive
- The ability to save the current information and close the program.
- The ability to save the information as a weekday.
- The ability to track the weekdays in the program, for quick visualization of the recent history.
